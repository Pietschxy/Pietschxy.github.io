      <div class="col-sm-10"><p class="description"></p>  Overwatch is a multiplayer-ego-shooter game which is based on a fictional world where robots, humans, cyborgs, and genetically modified animals fight for peace or destruction of the world. It was made by Blizzard Entertainment Studios which are famous for games like World of Warcraft or StarCraft. It was published on the 24th of May 2016 and since then it has always been a very enjoyable game.
              Every round starts with a hero-selection-screen. The heroes are separated into classes.
              There are Tanks who have a lot of health but are slow and don’t do a lot of damage and they often have a shield ability with that they can protect their team.
              Then there are Damage-Dealers (DD) who do a lot of damage and have unique abilities so they can fight either in the air or are fast on the ground.
              And last but not least Healers! They are there for… healing of course. Their abilities heal other players and they even do a lot of damage.
              Every team consists of 6 players and most of the time there are 2 tanks, 2 damage dealers and 2 healers. Each one of them is important for the success of the mission and communication is the most important thing. the game even has its own E-Sport tournament.

Minecraft had its first appearance on 17th May 2009 and since then over 125 million players enjoy the beautiful open world. With 235 million examples sold it is the most sold video game ever.
            The world inside the game is completely build of cubes and it sometimes breaks the laws of physics. But that is okay because when we want to play computer games we want to forget the real world. The world inside the game is very lively and you have several ways to start your journey. If you are lucky you even spawn beside a village and get some starter loot. But if you want to equip yourself like a badass, you have to go mining. Under the surface of the earth you can find lots of ores and resources which are useful on your journey. Eventually you discover some myths about the world and even encounter legendary creatures. But the best thing, you can play the survival mode with your friends.
            For those who don’t like farming there are several online servers where you can meet up or do some PVP.

  <br>
  All of these games tell us a story about the fight between the UNSC (United Nations Space Command) and the Alliance. Easier said a fight between humans and aliens. These games are set in the future where humanity can already travel through space. But in this story the aliens are the superior race and the only opportunity for the humans to win are the so-called Spartans. Spartans are modified humans. They are faster, stronger and generally taller than normal humans. Every spartan has a unique Armor which can hardly be destroyed. You play as a spartan and have to kill aliens and discover a lot of secrets in the universe.
